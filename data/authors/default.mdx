## Who am I
My name is Nicholas.  I'm an IT contractor based out of London, Ontario, Canada.

## What I am
- A technology enthusiast
- An IT contractor
- Assertive
- Supportive

## What I am sometimes
- A complete moron - but I'll make it right.
- On mute in the meeting to force me to shut up

## What I believe
- Credentials are worthless
- FOSS where possible
- Small contributions add up
- Seriously, Just Do It™.  Nobody else will Just Do It™ for you.

## Where I've worked
### TD Bank (Technical Command Center)
*Business Systems Analyst II - 2019-Present*

### Canada Life (Service Desk)
*Associate Service Desk Analyst - 2019*

This was my first support job.  The Enterprise Service Desk (now TD Helpdesk) hired me to work as a tier-one agent for employee technical support.  No interation with customers.  We supported nearly everything in the bank.  My roles included:

- Account unlocks & Password resets
- All production applications
- Knowledge base updates as required
- Training new employees (Canadian and US offices)
- Providing feedback to our tooling team

This made the job a great opportunity to learn on a daily basis.  Someone would call in, explain their issue, then it was up to me to determine how to fix their issue, or find the person or team who has the access or the knowledge to be able to assist.  I worked at the ESD for 2.5 years before being poached by London Life (now Canada Life) across the street to handle their O365 & Win10 migration, as well as training.

#### Autodata Solutions
*Automotive Configuration Author - 2015-2016*

The job title is overrated.  This was a data entry role contracted to Nissan/Infiniti by Autodata.  My team was assigned pricing and configurator options (Paint colors, packages, addons, sun roof, pricing, etc) in PDF or XLSX format, then we would manually convert this information to a format supported by their in-house database. Because of how trivial the work was, I spent my breaks and downtime creating AHK scripts to do my job for me.  When I took a task from JIRA, I'd hit go, then grab a coffee upstairs.  By the time I was back at my desk, the task was complete, or still working away.

Scripting was definitely the best method for data entry.  My work was completed faster, more accurately, and with less effort than everyone else on the team.  We were having regular meetings about setting the team up with my scripts, but I accepted a job offer from TD Bank before any of that could happen.
