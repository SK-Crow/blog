Hi, I'm Nicholas Sterner, a self-taught developer based in London, Ontario, Canada. I've been working in IT since 2010, focused on the financial sector since 2016.

I currently lead and own several projects:  [Sitekick Remastered](https://sitekickremastered.com), [GalaXseeds Remastered](https://galaxseedsremastered.com/).  Additionally, I develop apps independently under the name [Sterner.Digital](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Sterner.Digital&hl=en-US).

In my spare time, I tinker in my homelab, where I've built, hosted, and experimented with:

- **Hardware:** Heltec LoRa 32 v3 (Meshtastic), rackmounted server, rackmounted NAS, console modchip installation
- **Software:** Kemp Loadmaster, NextCloud, Plex, Radarr/Sonarr/Lidarr/Readarr/Prowlarr, Minio, Uptime Kuma, Kavita, mkdocs, HomeAssistant, Windows Server, freebsd
